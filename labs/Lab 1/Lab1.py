# Our aim in this Lab was to create a turtle who would follow the path of the cursor when clicked
# on and then would draw a line when cursor was released.
# Then we were to make a box which would change the color of the turtle and then line the turtle would make
# Some simple instructions which would also change colours when the box was clicked
# The Box couldnt change it's colour though
